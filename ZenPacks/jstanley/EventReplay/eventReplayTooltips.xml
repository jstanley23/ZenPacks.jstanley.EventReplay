        <html>Limit the number of events to save to redis. To save on memory.
            Once the limit is hit, older events will be purged as new come in.
            What's the Redis memory footprint?
            To give you a few examples (all obtained using 64-bit instances):
            An empty instance uses ~ 1MB of memory.
            1 Million small Keys -> String Value pairs use ~ 100MB of memory.
            1 Million Keys -> Hash value, representing an object with 5 fields, use ~ 200 MB of memory.</html>

        <html>Turn event saving function on or off. This will not effect
            replaying events already stored. You can turn this option on
            allow the events you are testing against to be gathered, then
            turn it off to prevent them from being over written.</html>
